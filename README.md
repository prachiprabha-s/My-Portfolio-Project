# Data Analysis using Python

### Objective

The objective of these projects is to develop robust Python programs that address three distinct challenges: managing a recipe database, analyzing sales data, and simulating product prices for sales prediction. Each project leverages Pythonâ€™s capabilities for data management, analysis, and user interaction, providing practical solutions to common data processing and analysis tasks.

### Context

These projects aim to enhance problem-solving skills and proficiency in Python programming by tackling real-world scenarios. By developing these solutions, the goal is to demonstrate the practical application of Python in data management, analysis, and simulation, catering to different domains such as culinary, sales, and retail.

### Methodology

1. **Data Import and Preparation:**
    - For each challenge, import data from CSV files where applicable.
    - Transform the data using pandas for sales and product data challenges.
    - Create necessary data structures (e.g., dictionaries, lists) for managing recipes.
2. **Function Definitions:**
    - **Create Recipe:** Define a function to create a recipe dictionary with the recipe name, list of ingredients, and instructions.
    - **Add Recipe:** Define a function to add a recipe dictionary to a list of recipes.
    - **Find Recipe:** Define a function to search for a recipe by name within the list of recipes.
    - **Display Recipe:** Define a function to print the recipe details in a user-friendly format.
3. **Sales Data Analysis:**
    - **Load Data:** Define a function to load sales data from a CSV file into a pandas Data Frame.
    - **Calculate Total Sales:** Define a function to calculate the total sales amount for each product.(Sorted by highest value)
    - **Find Top-Selling Products:** Define a function to identify the top-selling products based on total sales amount.
4. **Simulating Product Prices:**
    - **Load Product Data:** Define a function to load product data from a CSV file into a pandas Data Frame.
    - **Load Sales Data:** Define a function to load historical sales data from a CSV file into a pandas Data Frame.
    - **Simulate Prices:** Define a function to generate random initial prices for each product within a given range.
    - **Predict Sales Change:** Define a function to predict sales changes based on new simulated prices.
